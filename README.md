# Prediction_Score_Enzo_Gallo

Technical Test by Enzo GALLO for Footbar done in 2021

I completed this technical test in two formats using the same code.
You will find both a basic .py file and a .ipynb file.
The .ipynb version allows for better visualization of the plots I created and is thus more visually pleasant to browse.

To view my Ligue 1 match score prediction, please follow the steps below:

Run the .py file in the console using the command python prediction.py.
You can also execute this code via an IDE such as Spyder Python, for instance.
(Make sure you have installed the required libraries I used, including pandas, scipy, matplotlib, etc.)
If you prefer using the .ipynb file, you can run it via Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook.
When the file is executed, you will be able to view the plots.
At the end of execution, the PredictScore() function will launch. A small interface will prompt you to first enter the name of the home team, followed by the name of the away team. Once completed, the predicted match result will be displayed.
For this implementation, I used the Python programming language.

I did not create a makefile or a virtual environment; I apologize for this oversight.

I hope you will appreciate my work.

Best regards,
Enzo GALLO
